Notes about this assignment/project:

Main file for gui based csv file searching
    - file is IEEE parts catalogue for UNO IEEE room in PKI
        this is an ongoing project to help inform members of what is avaliable to be used
    - basic gui to input search parameters and restrictions
    - output in command line
        intended to have seperate gui window, did not impliment in time


catallogue_searcher.py
  - intended to be a seperate list of functions to search the CSV file for relevant results
  - currently only does basic search through whole file each time
      not sure if this would be better as a class or just the functions
	
todo: 
    add a way to search through listings that include a term, rather than exact matches (partly finished)
    add seperate dialogue window to display results rather than terminal and output file
    input and output formatting changes
    sorting of data
    output file or seperate gui output
